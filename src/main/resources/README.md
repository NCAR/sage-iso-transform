The following files are used for performing xml transformations from ISO 19139 (old iso xml) to the ISO 19115-3
(new iso xml).

Originally these files were downloaded from the iso standard website:
http://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/resources/transforms/ISO19139


However, due to some transforms (creation date) not working as expected, we have updated these transformation files to be what
is found on the GeoNetwork iso19115-3 plugin Github site:
